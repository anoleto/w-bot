# w-bot

this is a whatsapp-bot using [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js). pretty fast <br/><br/>
really look like a discord.js code isnt it? <br/>
im learning javascript with this tho! expect some weird try catches

## why await on the function that arent promise?
idk it looks funny (he thinks he on d.py)
